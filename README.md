# Grab Data from Google Trends

### Google Trends is an interesting site where one can get the relative information of what users search for using the Google browser. It does not have any hard numbers, such as this many people searched for this keyword this many times, but it does show you the relationship of one keyword search to another or between a given keyword and itself at a different time.

### Getting the data through pyautogui seemed like the easiest way to approach this grab of data. Sure it takes time, but it is accurate and if you are ok with leaving your computer on while you go do other things, this approach is fine. 

## To Run  
### Edit the <span>GrabGoogleTrends.py</span> file with the keywords that you want to search for.  

### If you want, also edit the times that the program sleeps for.
